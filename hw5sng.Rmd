1. What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated?

There are 1852 # of chocolate bars rated.

```
nrow(choco)
```

2. How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.

Based on the graph, the number of reports tends to increase in more recent years.

```
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(choco, aes(x=Review.Date)) + geom_bar()
```

3.
How are ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of ratings and describe it. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.

The ratings are distributed with a slight left skew. There are of course some outliers sitting at both extremes at ratings of 1.0 and 5.0.
```
ggplot(choco, aes(x=Rating)) + geom_histogram()
```

4.
Do ratings depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar?

Based on the graph below, not necessarily. There doesn't appear to have much of a correlation between Cocoa.Pct and Rating.

```
ggplot(choco, aes(x=Cocoa.Pct, y=Rating)) + geom_point() + geom_jitter()

```

5.
How do ratings compare across different company locations? Focus on the three locations with the most ratings:

Looking at the data, the USA tends to have almost a bimodel distribution around 3.0 and 3.5 slightly skewed left. France and Canada both have similar situations, but not skewed as much. 
```
top3 <- dplyr::filter(choco, Company.Location %in% c("U.S.A.", "France", "Canada"))

ggplot(top3, aes(x=Rating,fill = Company.Location)) + geom_histogram()
```

6.
Does Review Date affect Rating?

Although it is a bit hard to tell, it does seem that the Review Date and Rating might have a slight positive correlation.
```
ggplot(choco, aes(x=Review.Date, y=Rating)) + geom_point() + geom_jitter()
```

Final Thoughts - Using Github can slightly warp worktime making it a bit longer than individual usage, but I could imagine the practical uses are immense as it allows users to relay bits of code to each other at extreme speeds.
